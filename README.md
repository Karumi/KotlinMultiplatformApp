# ![Karumi logo][karumilogo] Kotlin multiplatform App

Application example using Kotlin multiplatform getting information from Dribbble.

### Import project

If you receive an error message reading "SDK location not found" while building the iOS project that means you need to define the SDK location path in a `local.properties` file for the Android SDK and NDK.

> local.properties:
```
ndk.dir=/Users/<username>/Library/Android/sdk/ndk-bundle
sdk.dir=/Users/<username>/Library/Android/sdk
```
